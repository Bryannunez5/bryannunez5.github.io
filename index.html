    <p>Extreme ironing (also called EI) is an extreme sport in which people take ironing boards to remote locations and iron items of clothing. According to the Extreme Ironing Bureau, extreme ironing is "the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt."[1]

Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown towards extreme ironing seems to center on the issue of whether it is really a sport or not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek.[2]

Some locations where such performances have taken place include a mountainside of a difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or snowboarding; on top of large bronze statues; in the middle of a street; underwater; in the middle of the M1 motorway;[3] race;[4] while parachuting;[5] and under the ice sheet of a frozen lake.[6] The performances have been conducted solo or by groups.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>

    <p>Extreme ironing was invented by Tony Hiam in 1980, near Settle in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in England. Inspired by his eccentric brother-in-law, John Slater, who ironed his clothes even when camping in a tent, Hiam illustrated the futility of unnecessary ironing by doing it in bizarre situations such as mountain-lookouts, crowded airport departure lounges, on top of telephone kiosks and charity clothing bins. Until 1990 Hiam often carried ironing board plus iron in his car-boot, on the lookout for opportunities to cause bystanders to glance twice, thinking: "Did I really see that?" Some purists of the sport, apparently unaware of its early origin, claim that it was started later in 1997 in Leicester, England, by resident Phil Shaw in his back garden.[2] Shaw came home from what he recalls as a hard day in a Leicester knitwear factory.[7] Shaw had a number of chores to do, including ironing his shirts. Preferring the idea of an evening out rock climbing, he decided to combine the two activities into a new extreme sport. In June 1999, Shaw, who uses the nickname "Steam", embarked on an international tour to promote the activity. The stops included the United States, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. An encounter with German tourists in New Zealand led to the formation of a group called "Extreme Ironing International", and the German Extreme Ironing Section or GEIS.[citation needed] This has yet to popularize in North America.
